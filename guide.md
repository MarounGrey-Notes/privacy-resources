Trying to figure out is it possible to be 100% anonimous online

## Messaging apps

1. Signal - the best app for messaging currently because they store no data on their users outside of your phone number. They don't know your contacts, your groups, etc. Also its open source, so people can actually check the code so they cant hide what are they doing with your privacy settings.<br>
2. Wickr -  No phone number or email address is required to register on Wickr Me. Your address book remains private and is not stored on our servers. No metadata is stored.<br><br>
(Best encryption is Signal, more privacy is Wickr)<br><br>

**Telegram vs Whatsapp** - Whatsapp owned by facebook. Telegam is not more private then Whatsapp. Telegram is not E2E encrypted by default and the server side code is not open source. Both of these are deal breakers for privacy.
